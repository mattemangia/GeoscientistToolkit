# ONNX Model Installer (Placeholder)

This folder is packaged with the installer so you can add ONNX models later.

## How to use

1. Drop your `.onnx` models inside the `models/` subfolder.
2. Run the installer script for your platform:
   - Windows: `install-onnx-models.cmd`
   - Linux/macOS: `install-onnx-models.sh`

The script copies the models into the `ONNX/` directory next to your installed application.
