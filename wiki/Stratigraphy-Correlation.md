# Stratigraphy Correlation

Compare stratigraphic charts side-by-side, visualize correlations, and export correlation tables for regional or educational analysis.

---

## Overview

The **Stratigraphy Correlation Viewer** aligns multiple stratigraphic schemes (International, US, UK, German, French, Italian, Spanish, and Mammal Ages). Correlation lines are drawn when units share the same international correlation codes, enabling quick comparison between regional frameworks.

---

## Open the Viewer

1. Go to **Tools → Stratigraphy Correlation Viewer**.
2. Use the toolbar to choose display level (Eon/Era/Period/Epoch/Age).

## Key Features

- **Toggle stratigraphies**: Show/hide individual columns per regional chart.
- **Correlation lines**: Draw links between units sharing international correlation codes.
- **Age scale & log view**: Switch between linear and log-style layouts; optionally show the age scale.
- **Orogenic markers**: Major orogenic events are displayed as contextual bands.
- **Export PNG**: Save the current view as an image.
- **Export correlation table**: Generate a CSV of adjacent-column correlations and boundary relationships.

## Export Behavior

- **PNG export** uses the provided file path in the export dialog.
- **Correlation tables** are written to your Documents folder with a timestamped filename:
  `stratigraphy_correlations_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv`.
